**Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify credit scores. Credit score classification is crucial for financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of individuals. By using machine learning techniques, we can automate and improve the accuracy of credit score assessments.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient model to classify credit scores based on various features. This classification helps in predicting the risk associated with lending to a particular individual.

**Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to train the classification model.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict credit scores on new data.

**Technologies Used**
- Python: Programming language used for developing the project.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running the code and visualizing results.

**Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps: 
**Clone the repository:** git clone https://github.com/Davedigital9/credit-score-classification.git
**Navigate to the project directory:** cd credit-score-classification
**Install the required dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
**Open the Jupyter Notebook:** jupyter notebook
Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**
The model's performance is evaluated based on various metrics, and the results are visualized using plots. The accuracy of the model and other evaluation metrics will be displayed in the notebook.
